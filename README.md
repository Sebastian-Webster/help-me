# Work in progress - not ready yet

The idea for this is to have a website for trainers and students to have open during a class.

Functionality for students:
Students would enter their names and whenever they need help they'll press a button to indicate they need help
If they solve the problem before the trainer(s) are able to get to them, they can press a button indicating they no longer need help
The students will be able to see who is getting help at the moment and what their place is in the queue; providing more transparency to the students

For classes with more than one trainer, this website will maximise the usage of trainers' time.
Since the students that need help will be put in a queue, when a trainer becomes available they can instantly help the next student and know who needs help
This maximises use of trainer time and minimises time waiting for help
